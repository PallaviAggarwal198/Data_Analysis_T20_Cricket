🏏 Cricket T20 World Cup 2022 - Data Analytics Project

I recently worked on a data analytics project where I used data from the T20 World Cup 2022 to build insights and select the best 11 players who could represent Earth in a match against aliens! 🛸

Tools & Tech Used:

Web Scraping (from ESPN Cricinfo using Bright Data)

Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and transformation

Power Query & DAX for data modeling

Power BI to build an interactive dashboard
